# Scratch
Ever been in the middle of a project and wanted to quickly open a new workspace to test something? Now you can with a single keystroke.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Linux
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [python rofi menu](https://github.com/miphreal/python-rofi-menu)
  - Just run `pip install rofi-menu`

## Installation
1. Clone the repo somewhere you can easily access
2. Edit `main.py` with the config variable you want 
3. Run `main.py` to ensure everything is working
4. Add `main.py` to a shortcut in whatever window manager you're using

If you're having trouble installing due to my error or you're just new to linux, feel free to create an issue.


## Configuration
Scratch uses the templates folder
